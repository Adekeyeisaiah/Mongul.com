  CS3 Portable Installer
Released simply to make sure end users don't get infected with nasty Trojans while they attempt to install any other CS3 Portable release out there...  

Installer compiled by Yoni http://windowsedge.com

Files scanned with Norton Antivirus 2007, Symantec Antivirus, McAfee Antivirus, Avast antivirus and AVG free Edition.

I have removed 2 Trojans that were added to the original WinRAR SFX. I also tuned the Adobe Setup batch file to make it more interactive and easier to use; and finally I compiled a simple installer that will make it absolutely painless for you to get Photoshop CS3 Portable installed and running. Please read the Info.pdf file for installation details.</p>

Adobe Photoshop CS3 LITE [No-Activation] 47 MB Only ! 

For those that have used my rip of Photoshop CS2 this is very similar but CS3. 
This is a rip of Photoshop CS3 Extended and includes all Plugin-Ins and Presets. Stuff that was ripped from 
Photoshop include: Help, Samples, Fonts, and Activation files. Tested and working on a clean install of XP and 
Vista in VMware.

This WinRAR SFX will unpack to %ProgramFiles%Adobe and about 71MB (binary files are packed with UPX LZMA).
 It will run a cmd file the first time which presents some options. Just hit '1' and 'Enter' to copy 
the cache.db file to get Extended. It also has some other useful options.</p>

<p>This rip was made using the crack provided by MrCobra, this rip is all but portable, no registry keys need to be 
imported, no dlls need to be registered for it to work. However it does need Admin access the first time to work. 
A portable launcher is in the works.

Well, I guess I helped him by making the portable version available and simple to use... Sorry mate but I "hate" to provide installers with Trojans, so I had them removed!
  
Enjoy guys! :)
